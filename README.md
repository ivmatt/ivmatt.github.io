# This is my personal website!

### How I built it

I designed the website using Figma and built it with React.

### Is it done?

Not completely.

### What's in it

It's got all the essential things a personal website should have. However, I plan to make more changes to make the website more interesting and fun.

It can also serve as React practice!

### What did I learn?

Although I have experience using React Native and creating components and all, this was my first time using React to create a website.

- HTML
- CSS
- Creating React components
- More git practice
- Deploying a website on Github Pages
- Using custom domains
- A whole lot of Figma
- File structure for a React website

### What difficulties did I encounter?

- Fitting that damn StuddyBuddy screenshot in it's card. For some reason, it would always extend the div beyond it's parent div which made no sense to me. Consulted a friend and he helped me with it.
- Got a lot of 404 errors when deploying the website. Reading through documentation SLOWLY helped a lot.

### Why it took a while

I was going back and forth over the design of my website and ended up spending too much time thinking about how it should look rather than getting it up.

### What do you plan on adding?

I'm thinking of the following things:

- Fun elements like draggable photos, hidden buttons or more animations!
- I enjoyed designing the website a lot and want to play around with other designs. Might add a button that will allow user to switch through the designs.
